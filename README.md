  ## Description

  ----------------------

  This project is a simple note taking app that uses an API in order to store the notes entered by the user. The back-end uses Node.js and Express.js in order to set up a server to allow for persistence storage. Each note is also stored with a unique ID. Heroku is used to deploy the live site.
